"""
The actual requirements are open to interpretation, but try to adhere
to these guidelines:

1. You should have at least four classes: the parent Animal class, and
then at least three child animal classes that inherit from Animal.

2. Each class should have a few attributes and at least one method
that models some behavior appropriate for a specific animal or all
animalsâ€”such as walking, running, eating, sleeping, and so on.

3. Keep it simple. Utilize inheritance. Make sure you output details
about the animals and their behaviors.

## instead of animal, I would like to solve a real life problem:
## what house you want to buy.
