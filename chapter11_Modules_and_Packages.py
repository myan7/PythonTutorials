11.1 Working With Modules
Module is like package in Java, just a namespace which can be imported
to make everything in there becomes available locally without recoding them.

Creating Modules
Technically, every Python script file
that you have created while reading this book is a module

Importing One Module Into Another

A namespace is a collection of names, such as variable names,
function names, and class names. Every Python module has its own
namespace.

To access a name in an imported module from the calling module, type
the imported moduleâ€™s name followed by a dot (.) and the name you
want to use:
<module>.<name>

Import Statement Variations

1. import <module> as <other_name>
You can change the name of an import using the as keyword
    There are two reasons you might use the
    import <module> as <other_name> format:
        1. The module name is long and you wish to import an abbreviated
           version of it
        2. The module name clashes with an existing name in the calling
           module


2. from <module> import <name>
Instead of importing the entire namespace,
you can import only a specific name from a module.
if you want to import more than 1 package,
use comma as separation.

Summary of Import Statements
Why Use Namespaces?

1. They group names into logical containers
2. They prevent clashes between duplicate names
3. They provide context to names

11.2 Working With Packages

Modules allow you to divide a program in to individual files that can be
reused as needed. Related code can be organized into a single module
and kept separate from other code.
Package take this organizational structure one step further
by allowing you to group related modules under a single namespace.
