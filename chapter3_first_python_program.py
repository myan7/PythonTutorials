# 3.1 Write a Python script

print("Hello Python!")
print("1 + 1 =",1+1)
print("round(0.5) is",round(0.5))
print("round(0.5,1) is",round(0.5,1))

# 3.2 Mess Things up
# Syntax error when uncomment next line
# print("Hello World!)
# run time error when uncomment next line
# print(Hello, world)


##======================================================================##

# 3.3 create a variable
phrase = "Hello Python!"
print(phrase)
问候="你好， Pyhon！"
print(问候)

# 3.4 Inspect Values in the interactive window

# copy the following lines in the interactive window
# you will see even without print(), Hello, Python! will be printed out.
phrase = "Hello, Python!"
phrase
# in the interactive window, it will look like this:
# >>> phrase = "Hello, Python!"
# >>> phrase
# 'Hello, Python!'
# you will not see it when you run it in IDLE by pressing F5
# this is called to inspect a variable

# if you use print(), you will see the difference
# something like this:
print(phrase)
# >>> print(phrase)
# Hello, Python!
# Notice if using print(), there will be no single quotes surrounding it.

# Key takeaway is
# print() displays a readable representation of a variable's value,
# while inspection provides additional information about the type of the value.


##======================================================================##

# 3.5 Leave yourself helpful notes

# this is a block comment
# you can either use it as a line, or append it to the code, for example
print(问候)  # this is a variable with Chinese name to indicate Python works with UniCode.

# but not in a string
print("#123")

##in windows, you can comment out multiple lines by highlighting the lines and
##pressing alt + 3, to uncomment out your code, hightlight the code and press
## alt + 4
